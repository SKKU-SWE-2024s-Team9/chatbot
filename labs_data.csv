1,"성균관대학교 소프트웨어 분석 연구실에서는 기계-학습 기법들을 통해 안전한 소프트웨어를 만드는 연구를 함께 수행할 학생을 모집합니다. 관심 있으신 학생은 제 이메일(sooyoung.cha@skku.edu)로 연락 주시면 됩니다.
학부 연구원 모집
기본적으로는 대학원 진학에 관심이 있는 3,4 학년 학부 연구원을 모집합니다.
연구원 기간 동안 저와 정기적인 미팅을 통해 연구의 기반을 준비하고 구체적인 연구 주제를 선정합니다.
요구되는 자질: 성실성, 호기심 및 열정, 기본적인 코딩 실력.   
대학원 신입생 모집
저에게 간단한 자기 소개서와 학부 성적 증명서를 메일로 보내주신 후 저와 개인 면담을 진행합니다.  
제 연구실은 대학원 입학 전에 인턴 기간을 거쳐야 하므로 입학하는 시기보다 미리 연락을 해주세요. 
연구 환경 
대학원생 등록금 및 생활비 지원. (학부 연구원 인건비 지원).
개인 컴퓨터, 서버 등 쾌적한 연구에 필요한 장비 지원. 
소프트웨어 공학 분야 TOP-4 국제 학회 참석 지원. (ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA)",sooyoung.cha@skku.edu
